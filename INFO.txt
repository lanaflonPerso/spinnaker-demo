Once running actuator exposing metrics for use at this endpoint , you need to scrap those into prometheus ->

# HELP jvm_classes_unloaded_classes_total The total number of classes unloaded since the Java virtual machine has started execution
# TYPE jvm_classes_unloaded_classes_total counter

# HELP hikaricp_connections Total connections

...

Scrap file: myapp.yaml

#Global configurations
global:
  scrape_interval:     5s # Set the scrape interval to every 5 seconds.
  evaluation_interval: 5s # Evaluate rules every 5 seconds.

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'spinnaker-app'
    metrics_path: '/actuator/prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['HOST_IP:PORT']

The above configuration file is an extension of the basic configuration file available in the Prometheus documentation.
The most important stuff to note in the above configuration file is the spring-actuator job inside scrape_configs section.
The metrics_path is the path of the Actuator’s prometheus endpoint. The targets section contains the HOST and PORT of your
Spring Boot application.

Please make sure to replace the HOST_IP with the IP address of the machine where your Spring Boot application is running.
Note that, localhost won’t work here because we’ll be connecting to the HOST machine from the docker container. You must
specify the network IP address.

OR use push gateway:
